/**
 * Manages cooldowns for features and commands, allowing you to set and check cooldown periods.
 * 
 * This class provides methods to set cooldowns for specific features or commands and to check if a cooldown is currently active.
 * Cooldowns are tracked using a key composed of the type ("feature" or "command") and the name.
 * 
 * @example
 * const manager = new CooldownManager();
 * manager.set("command", "ping", 5000); // Set a 5-second cooldown for the "ping" command
 * const remaining = manager.onCooldown("command", "ping"); // Get remaining cooldown time in ms
